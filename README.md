# 🔥 Custom Emoji
Custom emojis for OSRS.

## Download Emojis
The plugin does not come with built-in emojis. Download an emoji starter pack [here.](https://github.com/TheLouisHong/custom-emoji-repository/)

## Emoji
**The filename will become the trigger for the emoji. For example, `woow.png` means `woow` in-game will show `woow.png`.**

Supported file formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`

After copying new emojis, the plugin will automatically reload the changes and they'll be usable in the client immediately.

Type `::emojifolder` in-game chat to open the emoji folder. Otherwise, the folder is located at `.runelite/emoji`

## Soundoji (Sound Emoji)
**The filename will become the trigger for the soundoji. For example, `pipe.wav` means `pipe` in-game will play `pipe.wav`.**

Supported file formats: `.wav`

Type `::soundojifolder` in-game chat to open the soundoji folder. Otherwise, the folder is located at `.runelite/soundoji`

## FAQ

**Animated emoji?**
Soon™

**Will you please implement an autofill/autocomplete feature?**
[No.](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Rejected-or-Rolled-Back-Features#not-currently-being-considered)

**My emoji appears blank/invisible**
Some PNG files are encoded in ways that Java cannot read correctly, even though they display fine in image viewers and browsers. Re-save the image using any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.) or an online PNG converter to fix this.

**My emoji failed to load. What the frick?**
If you're seeing the error in the panel, try hitting the refresh button. Otherwise, type `::emojierror` in game to see the errors.
